      <p>
        If you've landed on this page I'm guessing you've gone through all the
        guitar pedal pages and they have left you in a state of complete
        confusion. I created this page because I was once in your exact same
        situation. There is a ton of information out there on pedals and a lot
        of it is conflicting information. Hopefully we can clear some of that
        up.
