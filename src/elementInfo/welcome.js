  Distortion: {
    title: "Distortion",
    text:
      "Distortion units are effectively the sonic equivalent of English football hooligans. A distortion pedal produces way more gain and also clips the signal way harder than an overdrive pedal while remaining pretty darned tight and articulate — certainly much more so than the father of all distortion pedals, the fuzz (stay tuned!). While, as already ascertained, an overdrive pedal creates soft clipping, distortion devices add a harder, more aggressive (edgier or squarer) clipping.",

  Fuzz: {
    title: "Fuzz",
    text:
      "The Fuzz pedal was the first-ever pedal to generate distortion. Fuzz is capable of creating gnarly, heavily clipped, and harmonically altered sounds that are often wonderfully hard to control. One big reason for this is that fuzz pedals invariably use transistors for gain as opposed to op-amps, and while op-amps are pretty hi-fi, transistors are the exact opposite — they’re lo-fi and add a heap of harmonics as they mash your signal into a square!

  Overdrive: {
    title: "Overdrive",
    text:
      "Overdrive pedals can sometimes be confused with distortion pedals, but make no mistake, an overdrive is a different animal altogether. Overdrive pedals drive your valves to the point of distortion, or at the very least mimic what that would sound like if you have a solid state amplifier. The purpose of an overdrive pedal is to mimic the sound of you turning up your valve amp as loud as it can go, except this a far safer (and neighbour friendly) option. It's probably the closest you can get to pure amplifier distortion without actually blowing out your windows.",

  Reverb: {
    title: "Reverb",
    text:
      "Reverb is one of the most fundamental effects for electric guitar, which is why it is already built into most amps. Reverb adds natural sounding depth to your sound. Used extensively in the recording world, electric guitars do not sound “right” without it. Just a little makes the guitar have more of a natural sound and decay, but you can go to the extremes and get cavernous depth to your sound. Plate and spring are the most common types, but with so many makers coming up with new sonic “spaces” to play in, finding your reverb sound is a priority.",

  Wah: {
    title: "Wah",
    text:
      "The wah pedal is characterised by a weeping, crying tone, akin to human voice. The guitar wasn’t the first instrument to benefit from this type of effect. As early as the 1920’s, trumpet players used hats and other baffles to cover and uncover the bell of their instruments to create a ’wah’ effect.",

  Delay: {
    title: "Delay",
    text:
      "Delay is essentially echo, but it can be so much more when used well. The two most important knobs are “time” and “repeats”. Time will increase the length between repeats, and repeats will adjust how many echoes are heard. While it is tempting to max the repeats and enter space rock land, less can be more. Used gently you can get reverb or slap-back rockabilly sounds. With careful knob setting you can even create harmonies and loops like The Edge.",

  Looping: {
    title: "Looping",
    text:
      "A loop pedal records a musical passage and then repeatedly plays it back on a loop. Once it is played back, most loop pedals allow for overdubbing new passages over the first one. Most loopers also can change the tempo as well as the direction (i.e. reverse) of the playback loop.",
